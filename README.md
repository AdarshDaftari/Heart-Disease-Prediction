ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive deep learning model to assess the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health indicators. Using a dataset of patient records, the model leverages neural networks to classify individuals into risk categories, helping healthcare professionals with early detection and preventive care strategies.

The project demonstrates the application of machine learning and data analytics to solve real-world healthcare challenges, showcasing technical expertise in data preprocessing, model design, and performance optimization.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on historical health data.

Apply neural networks to perform binary classification of patients.

Explore and visualize patterns in the dataset to understand key risk factors.

Build a scalable, accurate, and reliable prediction model suitable for healthcare analytics.
